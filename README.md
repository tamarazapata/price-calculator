# Price Calculator

This project is a simple web application that calculates the total price based on a fixed base amount and a quantity controlled by increment and decrement buttons. The project uses HTML and JavaScript to provide a dynamic user experience.

## Project Structure

- `base.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the page.
- `index.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic to handle the quantity and total price calculations.
- `estilos.css`: Optional CSS file for styling.

## How It Works

1. **Base Price**: The base price is set at $400,000.
2. **Quantity Controls**: Users can adjust the quantity of the item using the "+" and "-" buttons.
3. **Total Calculation**: The total price is calculated by multiplying the base price by the quantity.

## How to Run

2. Open the HTML File: Open `base.html` in a web browser to see the application in action.
